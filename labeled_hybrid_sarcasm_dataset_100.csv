"Oh, it's quite simple. Sarcasm, by definition, is **using irony, humor, or mockery to make a point—often in a way that’s the opposite of what’s expected**.  Now, take this AI-generated video of **Trump and Zelensky in a fight**—obviously, that’s not real. But it exaggerates their political personas and tensions in a ridiculous, over-the-top way. That’s the humor. That’s the irony. That’s the **sarcasm**.  If you're expecting serious political analysis, you're in the wrong place. The whole point of sarcasm is to highlight absurdity—whether it’s about world leaders, their actions, or just how people react to them.  So yeah, this video fits **perfectly** under sarcasm.

">Trump and the majority of conservatives have zero issues with immigrants. The problem we have is specifically illegal immigrants. I see this “argument” thrown around frequently and it just comes off as silly and misguided.  Then why aren't there any real conservative endeavors to make legal immigration easier? Why aren't conservatives scrambling to encourage immigrants when immigrants make more jobs per capita through creation of businesses, tend to be more educated, wealthier, more successful, and contribute more to the economy?  Why do conservatives rally against the scapegoat of ""illegal immigrants"" when a bigger issue is American-caused instabilities in regions that immigrate to the US, all the while those undocumented immigrants are *also* beneficial to the economy?  The agricultural industry would crash if all illegal immigrants were immediately found and deported.",Reddit,en,1
